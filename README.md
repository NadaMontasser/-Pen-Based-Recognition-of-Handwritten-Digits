#### Boosting
Use GradientBoosting classifier to classify test set samples. There are 2 important hyperparameters in GradientBoosting: the number of estimators, and
learning rate

#### Bagging
Apply bagging strategy to classify test set samples by using SVM and Decision
Tree algorithm as base estimators
